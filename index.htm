   About
  </h2>
  
  <p1>
Hi my name is Natalia. I am a current student at Fleming College. I am a 2019 graduate from the University of Toronto. I am passionate about wildlife, conservation and in particular I enjoy the study of reptiles and amphibians. 
    I am confident in my ability to work long hours in a variety of environments including in
hot/cold temperatures, rainy conditions and in the presence of biting/stinging insects. My past
field partners and supervisors are able to attest to my professionalism, high levels of energy and
ability to learn new skills quickly. Although field work can be difficult at times, I pride myself
on my ability to self-motivate and keep a positive attitude through the longest of workdays. I am
someone who does not tire easily, who can ensure that their field work is efficient and their data
collection is accurate.

<p1>
I completed a fourth year thesis project based on data collected on the <a href="NHrynko_Poster.pdf">Bliss Project</a>. My thesis was titled Calculating the total biomass of breeding amphibians at Bat Lake,
Algonquin Park. The poster created was awarded honorable mention in the <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/news/eeb-students-awarded-prize-recognizing-best-undergraduate-research">Undergraduate Poster Fair, Category - Life history ecology and evolution </a>

  In this position I planned and led reptile and amphibian surveys within remote areas
  of central Ontario, Canada with an emphasis on species at risk. This position required I identify and collect spatial, morphometric, DNA data from a
  variety of reptile and amphibian species. Additionally I Conducted road mortality and nesting surveys: road cruised for
  nesting females, caged suitable nests, collected high risk nests forartificial incubation. </div>
